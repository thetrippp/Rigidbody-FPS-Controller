# Rigidbody-FPS-Controller
Rigidbody FPS Controller for Unity3D. 

Modified version of DaniDev's Rigidbody FPS Controller.
Original tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAC8U9-dTZU&t=1s
DANI YOU ABSOLUTE MONSTER!!

Allowed movement while crouching.
Wall Bouncing.(Kinda Cool)
Wall Climbing.

Updates?
-Animations.
-More Customizability.

Also included is a file that allows for a better feeling and more responsive and tactile jumping from the tutorial by BOARD TO BITS GAMES: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KiK0Aqtmzc
I really suggest you use this, it makes jumping feel so much more video game like and organic.

Cheers,
Tripwire
